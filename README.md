*insert latex commands more quickly by keybindings*

Many users will simply not adopt mathjax/chem as a part of their posts even after a month of using Chem.SE. They leave this task upto more reputed users. But even those users can quickly get bored of this mundane work of formatting these posts (unless they are, well, the tireless moderators, who have edited >2k posts!)

So, this simple Chrome/Opera/Firefox extension aims to give these superusers some quick key bindings to speed up the process of editing chem/mathjax into posts.

Update: 24/Mar/2018: All of the features have now been implemented, and this unpacked extension is currently provided as is. Standard MIT License applies.

**Example usage**:

1. Pressing Alt+Shift+P would insert `\pi` directly.
2. Pressing Alt+Shift+R would insert `\mathrm{%caret%}` with the caret auto-placed in the middle.
3. Pressing Alt+Shift+R with some `text` pre-selected would insert `\mathrm{text}`.
4. Prepending Ctrl to any of the above keybindings will auto-surround the insertion text with `$$`

**Features:**

1. The keybinding and its associated insertion text can be modified by the user.
